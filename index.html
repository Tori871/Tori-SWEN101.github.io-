    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> I attended highschool in Connecticut. I was originally from New York but moved during junior high. A few of my favorite hobbies are painting, badminton, singing, dancing and playing instruments. I am fond of organizing and working with circuits. I have an unhealthy obession with mangoes and fruits. I love R&B music and led lights. </p>
